Project 1
Year - C ++ Given the following rules, write a program to read a year (4 digit integer) and tell whether the given year is/was a leap year. There were no leap years before 1752. • If the year divides by 400 then it is a leap year. • All other years that divide by 100 are not leap years. • All other years that divide by four are leap years. • For example, 1800,1900 were not leap years but 2000 will be; 1904, 1908,...,1996 were/will be leap years.


Project 2
A function is required that checks strings to see if they are palindromes. A palindrome string that reads the same, backwards, or forwards. For example, • I was able no on elba saw I • The palindrome can be even or odd in length. Give the body to the following function and write a main() to read in strings from the user and pass them to your function to test it. It returns TRUE if the string passed in is a palindrome: • int is_palindrome(char *s); • Note that strings are terminated with the zero valued character. For the purposes of this exercise, the terminating zero is not part of the string.
